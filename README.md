=======

The Grid is an adaptive focused responsive frame work.

Right now all you have is a container and columns. 
It's built with sass. The awsome part is you decied
how many columns you need.

The next level aspect is 9 break points. 3 for phones,
3 for tablets, 3 for desktops. This helps cover 95% of
all screens so you can design adaptivlly and not just
reponsivly.
